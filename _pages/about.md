At Sir C.V. Raman High School, we believe in nurturing young minds, fostering a love for learning, and preparing students to become responsible global citizens. Our institution has a long-standing tradition of academic excellence, combined with a holistic approach to education that focuses on character development and the pursuit of individual passions.

By the inspiration of Sir C.V. Raman, we established a school in 2006 in his honor. Our decision to name the school after him was driven by the profound impact he had on the field of science and his relentless pursuit of knowledge. We sought to create an institution that embodies his spirit of curiosity, innovation, and scientific excellence. Beside our academic pursuits, we also seek to instill in our students a sense of social responsibility and ethical values, mirroring Sir CV Raman's commitment to using science for the betterment of society. 

Since then, our school has been a beacon of education in our community for many years. We are proud to have a dedicated team of experienced and passionate educators who are committed to providing the best possible learning experience for our students.

Our school offers a comprehensive curriculum that encompasses a wide range of subjects and disciplines, including languages, mathematics, sciences, humanities, arts, and physical education. We strive to create a stimulating and inclusive learning environment where students can explore their interests, develop critical thinking skills, and cultivate a thirst for knowledge.

Beyond academic excellence, we believe in the importance of character education. Our school values integrity, empathy, resilience, and respect. We aim to instill these values in our students, empowering them to become compassionate and socially responsible individuals who can make a positive impact in their communities and the world.

We understand that each student is unique, with their own strengths, interests, and learning styles. That's why we offer a variety of co-curricular activities and enrichment programs to cater to diverse talents and passions. From sports and arts to debate clubs and community service initiatives, we provide ample opportunities for students to explore their interests, develop their skills, and build lifelong friendships.

At our school, we also recognize the importance of technology in today's rapidly evolving world.Our school is equipped with modern facilities and resources to support digital literacy and technological proficiency among our students. We strive to integrate technology into our teaching methods, preparing students to thrive in an increasingly interconnected and digital society.

We believe that strong partnerships between school, parents, and the wider community are crucial for a student's success. We encourage active involvement and collaboration among all stakeholders, fostering a supportive and inclusive learning environment that nurtures the growth and well-being of our students.

We invite you to explore our various programs, faculty, facilities, and achievements at the school. Should you have any further questions or require additional information, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We look forward to welcoming you to our school community.
